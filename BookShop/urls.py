"""@package api
Documentation for api.
@brief Elegant URL scheme is an important in a high-quality Web application.
Django lets you design URLs however you want, with no framework limitations.
To design URLs you create a Python module informally called a URLconf.
This module is a mapping between URL path expressions to views.
This mapping can be as short or as long as needed.
It can reference other mappings.
And, because itâ€™s pure Python code, it can be constructed dynamically.
